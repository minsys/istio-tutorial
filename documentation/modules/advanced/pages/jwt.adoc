In this chapter, we are going to see how to enable authenticating end user with Istio.
At the time of writing this chapter, only the JWT mechanism is supported.

[#preparation]
== Before Start

To use JWT end-user authentication, we need a JWT issuer.
In this case, we are going to use https://www.keycloak.org/[Keycloak] but notice that any other one is valid as well.

Before starting let's deploy Keycloak in our `tutorial` namespace.

[source, bash]
----
oc apply -f keycloak/Deployment.yml -n tutorial 
oc create -f keycloak/Service.yml -n tutorial

oc expose service keycloak
----

Follow the deployment of Keycloak using the command

[source, bash]
----
oc get pods -w
----

Wait until the status is Running and there is 1/1 pod in the Ready column. To exit, press Ctrl+C

Now we need to configure Keycloak with realms, users, passwords, roles ...

So open Keycloak administration web page by opening a browser to 

[source, bash]
----
open http://keycloak-tutorial.$(minishift ip).nip.io/
----

Then select `administration console` option and use `admin/admin` as login/password.

And you'll get something like:

Then create a new `realm`. Just move the pointer over `Master` section which is found in upper-left section and click on `Add realm` button. 

image:keycloak-create_realm.png[Create Realm]

Select the file "keycloak/istio-realm.json" and click on "Create".

And finally, go to "Users" and create a user called `demo` under the previous role.

image:keycloak-create_user.png[Create User]

image:keycloak-assign_user_role.png[Assign Role User]

Select the role from `Available Roles` section and push `Add selected`.

Then go to Credentials and set `demo` as the password.

Finally, go again to Details tab and in Required User Actions input, remove the Update Password action.

And finally push Save button.

== Enabling User-End Authentication

Now it is time to enable end-user authentication.

The first thing you need to do is run `curl customer-tutorial.$(minishift ip).nip.io` and validate that now it is still possible to communicate between all services without been authenticated.

[source, bash]
----
curl customer-tutorial.$(minishift ip).nip.io

customer => preference => recommendation v1 from 'b4d67bcb7-7rp88': 4
----

After that open the file `istiofiles/enduser-authentication-jwt.yml` and replace the IP of fields `issuer` and `jwksUri` by your minishift IP (`minishift ip`).

[source, yaml]
.istiofiles/enduser-authentication-jwt.yml
----
spec:
  origins:
  - jwt:
      issuer: "http://keycloak-tutorial.192.168.64.87.nip.io/auth/realms/istio"
      jwksUri: "http://keycloak-tutorial.192.168.64.87.nip.io/auth/realms/istio/protocol/openid-connect/certs"
      audiences:
      - customer-tutorial
  principalBinding: USE_ORIGIN
----

And then run:

[source, bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
istioctl create -f link:{github-repo}/{istiofiles-dir}/enduser-authentication-jwt.yml[istiofiles/enduser-authentication-jwt.yml]
----

Then let's run the curl again:

[source, bash]
----
curl customer-tutorial.$(minishift ip).nip.io

Origin authentication failed.%`
----

And now the communication is not possible because the user has not been identified (provides a valid JWT token).

To get a correct token, just run next `curl` request.

[source, bash]
----
token=$(curl http://keycloak-tutorial.$(minishift ip).nip.io/auth/realms/istio/protocol/openid-connect/token -d 'username=demo&password=demo&grant_type=password&client_id=customer-tutorial'| python -c "import json,sys;obj=json.load(sys.stdin);print obj['access_token'];")

echo $token
----

And set the content of attribute `access_token` into `token` variable in your terminal.

If you want to see what is inside the token just go to https://jwt.io/[jwt.io] in _Debugger_ section and paste the token.

image:keycloak-jwt_token.png[]

Notice how `aud` field is set to `customer-tutorial.` 

[source, bash]
----
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $token" customer-tutorial.$(minishift ip).nip.io

customer => preference => recommendation v1 from 'b4d67bcb7-7rp88': 4
----

Now just change some part of the token and send the request again, you'll notice that request is refused.

[IMPORTANT]
====
In this chapter you've seen how to enable end-user authentication with JWT.

Obviously, you should also enable mTLS to avoid any attacker could take the token.

Check xref:mTLS.adoc[mTLS section] to learn more about mTLS and Istio.

[#cleanup]
== Clean Up

[source, bash]

istioctl delete -f istiofiles/enduser-authentication-jwt.yml
oc delete -f keycloak/Deployment.yml -n tutorial 
oc delete -f keycloak/Service.yml -n tutorial
oc delete route keycloak
