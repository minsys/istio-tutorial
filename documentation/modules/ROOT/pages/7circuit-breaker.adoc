.Before Start
====
You should have NO virtualservice nor destinationrule (in `tutorial` namespace) `istioctl get virtualservice` `istioctl get destinationrule` 
if so run:

[source, bash]

./scripts/clean.sh

[#failfast]
== Fail Fast with Max Connections and Max Pending Requests

First, make sure to uncomment `router.get(&quot;/&quot;).handler(this::timeout);` in the RecommendationVerticle.java:

[source,java]
----
    Router router = Router.router(vertx);
    router.get("/").handler(this::logging);
    router.get("/").handler(this::timeout);
    router.get("/").handler(this::getRecommendations);
    router.get("/misbehave").handler(this::misbehave);
    router.get("/behave").handler(this::behave);
----

And follow the Updating &amp; redeploying code steps to get this slower v2 deployed.

Second, you need to *ensure* you have a `destinationrule` and `virtualservice` in place. Let's use a 50/50 split of traffic:

[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
istioctl create -f link:{github-repo}/{istiofiles-dir}/destination-rule-recommendation-v1-v2.yml[istiofiles/destination-rule-recommendation-v1-v2.yml] -n tutorial
istioctl create -f link:{github-repo}/{istiofiles-dir}/virtual-service-recommendation-v1_and_v2_50_50.yml[istiofiles/virtual-service-recommendation-v1_and_v2_50_50.yml] -n tutorial

[#nocircuitbreaker]
=== Load test without circuit breaker

Let's perform a load test in our system with `siege`. We'll have 20 clients sending 2 concurrent requests each:

[source,bash]
----
siege -r 2 -c 20 -v customer-tutorial.$(minishift ip).nip.io
----

You should see an output similar to this:

image:siege_ok.png[siege output with all successful requests]

All of the requests to our system were successful, but it took some time to run the test, as the `v2` instance/pod was a slow performer.

But suppose that in a production system this 3s delay was caused by too many concurrent requests to the same instance/pod. We don't want multiple requests getting queued or making the instance/pod even slower. So we'll add a circuit breaker that will *open* whenever we have more than 1 request being handled by any instance/pod.

[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
istioctl replace -f link:{github-repo}/{istiofiles-dir}/destination-rule-recommendation_cb_policy_version_v2.yml[istiofiles/destination-rule-recommendation_cb_policy_version_v2.yml] -n tutorial

istioctl get destinationrule -n tutorial

[#circuitbreaker]
=== Load test with circuit breaker

Now let's see what is the behavior of the system running `siege` again:

[source,bash]
----
siege -r 2 -c 20 -v customer-tutorial.$(minishift ip).nip.io
----

image:siege_cb_503.png[siege output with some 503 requests due to open circuit breaker]

You can run siege multiple times, but in all of the executions you should see some `503` errors being displayed in the results. That's the circuit breaker being opened whenever Istio detects more than 1 pending request being handled by the instance/pod.

Clean up

[source,bash]
----
istioctl delete virtualservice recommendation -n tutorial
istioctl delete -f istiofiles/destination-rule-recommendation_cb_policy_version_v2.yml -n tutorial
----

or you can run:

[source, bash]
----
./scripts/clean.sh
----

[#poolejection]
== Pool Ejection

Pool ejection or _outlier detection_ is a resilience strategy that takes place whenever we have a pool of instances/pods to serve a client request. If the request is forwarded to a certain instance and it fails (e.g. returns a 50x error code), then Istio will eject this instance from the pool for a certain _sleep window_. In our example the sleep window is configured to be 15s. This increases the overall availability by making sure that only healthy pods participate in the pool of instances.

First, you need to insure you have a `destinationrule` and `virtualservice` in place to send traffic to the services. Let's use a 50/50 split of traffic:

[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
istioctl create -f link:{github-repo}/{istiofiles-dir}/destination-rule-recommendation-v1-v2.yml[istiofiles/destination-rule-recommendation-v1-v2.yml] -n tutorial
istioctl create -f link:{github-repo}/{istiofiles-dir}/virtual-service-recommendation-v1_and_v2_50_50.yml[istiofiles/virtual-service-recommendation-v1_and_v2_50_50.yml] -n tutorial
----

Scale number of instances of `v2` deployment

[source,bash]
----
oc scale deployment recommendation-v2 --replicas=2 -n tutorial
oc get pods -w

or

kubectl scale deployment recommendation-v2 --replicas=2 -n tutorial
kubectl get pods -w
----

Wait for all the pods to be in the ready state.

[#nofailinginstances]
=== Test behavior without failing instances

Throw some requests at the customer endpoint:

[source,bash]
----
./scripts/run.sh
----

You will see the load balancing 50/50 between the two different versions of the `recommendation` service. And within version `v2`, you will also see that some requests are handled by one pod and some requests are handled by the other pod.

[source,bash]

[#failinginstancesnopoolejection]
=== Test behavior with failing instance and without pool ejection

Let's get the name of the pods from recommendation `v2`:

[source,bash]
----
oc get pods -l app=recommendation,version=v2
or
kubectl get pods -l app=recommendation,version=v2
----

You should see something like this:

[source,bash]
----
recommendation-v2-2036617847-hdjv2   2/2       Running   0          1h
recommendation-v2-2036617847-spdrb   2/2       Running   0          7m
----

Now we'll get into one the pods and add some erratic behavior on it. Get one of the pod names from your system and replace on the following command accordingly:

[source,bash]
----
oc exec -it $(oc get pods|grep recommendation-v2|awk '{ print $1 }'|head -1) -c recommendation /bin/bash
or
kubectl exec -it $(oc get pods|grep recommendation-v2|awk '{ print $1 }'|head -1) -c recommendation /bin/bash
----

You will be inside the application container of your pod `recommendation-v2-2036617847-spdrb`. Now execute:

[source,bash]
----
curl localhost:8080/misbehave
exit
----

This is a special endpoint that will make our application return only `503`s.

Throw some requests at the customer endpoint:

[source,bash]
----
./scripts/run.sh
----

You'll see that whenever the pod `recommendation-v2-2036617847-spdrb` receives a request, you get a `503` error:

=== Test behavior with failing instance and with pool ejection

----

Throw some requests at the customer endpoint:

[source,bash]
----
./scripts/run.sh
----

You will see that whenever you get a failing request with `503` from the pod `recommendation-v2-2036617847-spdrb`, it gets ejected from the pool, and it doesn't receive any more requests until the sleep window expires - which takes at least 15s.

[#circuitbreakerandpoolejection]
== Ultimate resilience with retries, circuit breaker, and pool ejection

Even with pool ejection your application doesn't _look_ that resilient. That's probably because we're still letting some errors to be propagated to our clients. But we can improve this. If we have enough instances and/or versions of a specific service running into our system, we can combine multiple Istio capabilities to achieve the ultimate backend resilience:
- *Circuit Breaker* to avoid multiple concurrent requests to an instance;
- *Pool Ejection* to remove failing instances from the pool of responding instances;
- *Retries* to forward the request to another instance just in case we get an open circuit breaker and/or pool ejection;

By simply adding a *retry* configuration to our current `virtualservice`, we'll be able to get rid completely of our `503`s requests. This means that whenever we receive a failed request from an ejected instance, Istio will forward the request to another supposably healthy instance.
